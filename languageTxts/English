   English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early
   medieval England and is now a global lingua franca.^[4]^[5] Named after
   the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to England, it
   ultimately derives its name from the Anglia (Angeln) peninsula in the
   Baltic Sea. It is closely related to the Frisian languages, but its
   vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic
   languages, particularly Norse (a North Germanic language), as well as
   by Latin and Romance languages, especially French.^[6]

   English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years. The
   earliest forms of English, a set of Anglo Frisian dialects brought to
   Great Britain by Anglo Saxon settlers in the 5th century, are called
   Old English. Middle English began in the late 11th century with the
   Norman conquest of England, and was a period in which the language was
   influenced by French.^[7] Early Modern English began in the late 15th
   century with the introduction of the printing press to London and the
   King James Bible, and the start of the Great Vowel Shift.^[8]

   Through the worldwide influence of the British Empire, modern English
   spread around the world from the 17th to mid 20th centuries. Through
   all types of printed and electronic media, as well as the emergence of
   the United States as a global superpower, English has become the
   leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in
   many regions and in professional contexts such as science, navigation
   and law.^[9]

   English is the third most widespread native language in the world,
   after Standard Chinese and Spanish.^[10] It is the most widely learned
   second language and is either the official language or one of the
   official languages in almost 60 sovereign states. There are more people
   who have learned it as a second language than there are native
   speakers. English is the most commonly spoken language in the United
   Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand,
   and it is widely spoken in some areas of the Caribbean, Africa and
   South Asia.^[11] It is co official language of the United Nations, of
   the European Union and of many other world and regional international
   organisations. It is the most widely spoken Germanic language,
   accounting for at least 70% of speakers of this Indo European branch.
   English has a vast vocabulary, and counting exactly how many words it
   has is impossible.^[12]^[13]

   Modern English grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical
   Indo European dependent marking pattern with a rich inflectional
   morphology and relatively free word order, to a mostly analytic pattern
   with little inflection, a fairly fixed SVO word order and a complex
   syntax.^[14] Modern English relies more on auxiliary verbs and word
   order for the expression of complex tenses, aspect and mood, as well as
   passive constructions, interrogatives and some negation. Despite
   noticeable variation among the accents and dialects of English used in
   different countries and regions – in terms of phonetics and phonology,
   and sometimes also vocabulary, grammar and spelling – English speakers
   from around the world are able to communicate with one another with
   relative ease.

   Phylogenetic tree showing the historical relations between the
   languages of the West Germanic branch of the Germanic languages

   English is an Indo European language, and belongs to the West Germanic
   group of the Germanic languages.^[15] Old English originated from a
   Germanic tribal and linguistic continuum along the coast of the North
   Sea, whose languages are now known as the Anglo Frisian subgroup within
   West Germanic. As such, the modern Frisian languages are the closest
   living relatives of Modern English. Low German/Low Saxon is also
   closely related, and sometimes English, the Frisian languages, and Low
   German are grouped together as the Ingvaeonic, though this grouping
   remains debated.^[16] Old English evolved into Middle English, which in
   turn evolved into Modern English.^[17] Particular dialects of Old and
   Middle English also developed into a number of other English (Anglic)
   languages, including Scots^[18] and the extinct Fingallian and Forth
   and Bargy (Yola) dialects of Ireland.^[19]

   Like Icelandic and Faroese, the development of English on the British
   Isles isolated it from the continental Germanic languages and
   influences, and has since undergone substantial evolution. English is
   thus not mutually intelligible with any continental Germanic language,
   differing in vocabulary, syntax, and phonology, although some, such as
   Dutch or Frisian, do show strong affinities with English, especially
   with its earlier stages.^[20]

   Unlike Icelandic or Faroese, the long history of invasions of the
   British Isles by other peoples and languages, particularly Old Norse
   and Norman French, left a profound mark of their own on the language,
   such that English shares substantial vocabulary and grammar
   similarities with many languages outside its linguistic clades, while
   also being unintelligible with any of those languages. Some scholars
   have even argued that English can be considered a mixed language or a
   creole – a theory called the Middle English creole hypothesis. Although
   the high degree of influence from these languages on the vocabulary and
   grammar of Modern English is widely acknowledged, most specialists in
   language contact do not consider English to be a true mixed
   language.^[21]^[22]

   English is classified as a Germanic language because it shares
   innovations with other Germanic languages such as Dutch, German, and
   Swedish.^[23] These shared innovations show that the languages have
   descended from a single common ancestor called Proto Germanic. Some
   shared features of Germanic languages include the use of modal verbs,
   the division of verbs into strong and weak classes, and the sound
   changes affecting Proto Indo European consonants, known as Grimm's and
   Verner's laws. English is classified as an Anglo Frisian language
   because Frisian and English share other features, such as the
   palatalisation of consonants that were velar consonants in
   Proto Germanic (see Phonological history of Old English
   § Palatalization).^[24]
   The opening to the Old English epic poem Beowulf, handwritten in
   half uncial script:
   Hƿæt ƿē Gārde/na ingēar dagum þēod cyninga / þrym ge frunon...
   "Listen! We of the Spear Danes from days of yore have heard of the
   glory of the folk kings..."

   The earliest form of English is called Old English or Anglo Saxon (c.
   550–1066 CE). Old English developed from a set of North Sea Germanic
   dialects originally spoken along the coasts of Frisia, Lower Saxony,
   Jutland, and Southern Sweden by Germanic tribes known as the Angles,
   Saxons, and Jutes. In the fifth century, the Anglo Saxons settled
   Britain as the Roman economy and administration collapsed. By the
   seventh century, the Germanic language of the Anglo Saxons became
   dominant in Britain, replacing the languages of Roman Britain (43–409
   CE): Common Brittonic, a Celtic language, and Latin, brought to Britain
   by the Roman occupation.^[25]^[26]^[27] England and English (originally
   Ænglaland and Ænglisc) are named after the Angles.^[28]

   Old English was divided into four dialects: the Anglian dialects,
   Mercian and Northumbrian, and the Saxon dialects, Kentish and West
   Saxon.^[29] Through the educational reforms of King Alfred in the ninth
   century and the influence of the kingdom of Wessex, the West Saxon
   dialect became the standard written variety.^[30] The epic poem Beowulf
   is written in West Saxon, and the earliest English poem, Cædmon's Hymn,
   is written in Northumbrian.^[31] Modern English developed mainly from
   Mercian, but the Scots language developed from Northumbrian. A few
   short inscriptions from the early period of Old English were written
   using a runic script.^[32] By the sixth century, a Latin alphabet was
   adopted, written with half uncial letterforms. It included the runic
   letters wynn ⟨ƿ⟩ and thorn ⟨þ⟩, and the modified Latin letters eth ⟨ð⟩,
   and ash ⟨æ⟩.^[32]^[33]

   Old English is very different from Modern English and difficult for
   21st century English speakers to understand. Its grammar was similar to
   that of modern German, and its closest relative is Old Frisian. Nouns,
   adjectives, pronouns, and verbs had many more inflectional endings and
   forms, and word order was much freer than in Modern English. Modern
   English has case forms in pronouns (he, him, his) and a few verb
   endings (I have, he has), but Old English had case endings in nouns as
   well, and verbs had more person and number endings.^[34]^[35]^[36]

   The translation of Matthew 8:20 from 1000 CE shows examples of case
   endings (nominative plural, accusative plural, genitive singular) and a
   verb ending (present plural):

          Foxas habbað holu and heofonan fuglas nest
          Fox as habb að hol u and heofon an fugl as nest ∅
          fox NOM.PL have PRS.PL hole ACC.PL and heaven GEN.SG bird NOM.PL
          nest ACC.PL
          "Foxes have holes and the birds of heaven nests"^[37]

   Englischmen þeyz hy hadde fram þe bygynnyng þre manner speche,
   Souþeron, Northeron, and Myddel speche in þe myddel of þe lond, …
   Noþeles by comyxstion and mellyng, furst wiþ Danes, and afterward wiþ
   Normans, in menye þe contray longage ys asperyed, and som vseþ strange
   wlaffyng, chyteryng, harryng, and garryng grisbytting.
   Although, from the beginning, Englishmen had three manners of speaking,
   southern, northern and midlands speech in the middle of the country, …
   Nevertheless, through intermingling and mixing, first with Danes and
   then with Normans, amongst many the country language has arisen, and
   some use strange stammering, chattering, snarling, and grating
   gnashing.

   In the period from the 8th to the 12th century, Old English gradually
   transformed through language contact into Middle English. Middle
   English is often arbitrarily defined as beginning with the conquest of
   England by William the Conqueror in 1066, but it developed further in
   the period from 1200–1450.

   First, the waves of Norse colonisation of northern parts of the British
   Isles in the 8th and 9th centuries put Old English into intense contact
   with Old Norse, a North Germanic language. Norse influence was
   strongest in the Northeastern varieties of Old English spoken in the
   Danelaw area around York, which was the centre of Norse colonisation;
   today these features are still particularly present in Scots and
   Northern English. However the centre of norsified English seems to have
   been in the Midlands around Lindsey, and after 920 CE when Lindsey was
   reincorporated into the Anglo Saxon polity, Norse features spread from
   there into English varieties that had not been in intense contact with
   Norse speakers. Some elements of Norse influence that persist in all
   English varieties today are the pronouns beginning with th  (they,
   them, their) which replaced the Anglo Saxon pronouns with h  (hie, him,
   hera).^[39]

   With the Norman conquest of England in 1066, the now norsified Old
   English language was subject to contact with the Old Norman language, a
   Romance language closely related to Modern French. The Norman language
   in England eventually developed into Anglo Norman. Because Norman was
   spoken primarily by the elites and nobles, while the lower classes
   continued speaking Anglo Saxon, the influence of Norman consisted of
   introducing a wide range of loanwords related to politics, legislation
   and prestigious social domains.^[40] Middle English also greatly
   simplified the inflectional system, probably in order to reconcile Old
   Norse and Old English, which were inflectionally different but
   morphologically similar. The distinction between nominative and
   accusative case was lost except in personal pronouns, the instrumental
   case was dropped, and the use of the genitive case was limited to
   describing possession. The inflectional system regularised many
   irregular inflectional forms,^[41] and gradually simplified the system
   of agreement, making word order less flexible.^[42] By the Wycliffe
   Bible of the 1380s, the passage Matthew 8:20 was written

          Foxis han dennes, and briddis of heuene han nestis^[43]

   Here the plural suffix  n on the verb have is still retained, but none
   of the case endings on the nouns are present.

   By the 12th century Middle English was fully developed, integrating
   both Norse and Norman features; it continued to be spoken until the
   transition to early Modern English around 1500. Middle English
   literature includes Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, and
   Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. In the Middle English period the use of
   regional dialects in writing proliferated, and dialect traits were even
   used for effect by authors such as Chaucer.

   Graphic representation of the Great Vowel Shift, showing how the
   pronunciation of the long vowels gradually shifted, with the high
   vowels i: and u: breaking into diphthongs and the lower vowels each
   shifting their pronunciation up one level

   The next period in the history of English was Early Modern English
   (1500–1700). Early Modern English was characterised by the Great Vowel
   Shift (1350–1700), inflectional simplification, and linguistic
   standardisation.

   The Great Vowel Shift affected the stressed long vowels of Middle
   English. It was a chain shift, meaning that each shift triggered a
   subsequent shift in the vowel system. Mid and open vowels were raised,
   and close vowels were broken into diphthongs. For example, the word
   bite was originally pronounced as the word beet is today, and the
   second vowel in the word about was pronounced as the word boot is
   today. The Great Vowel Shift explains many irregularities in spelling,
   since English retains many spellings from Middle English, and it also
   explains why English vowel letters have very different pronunciations
   from the same letters in other languages.^[44]^[45]

   English began to rise in prestige during the reign of Henry V. Around
   1430, the Court of Chancery in Westminster began using English in its
   official documents, and a new standard form of Middle English, known as
   Chancery Standard, developed from the dialects of London and the East
   Midlands. In 1476, William Caxton introduced the printing press to
   England and began publishing the first printed books in London,
   expanding the influence of this form of English.^[46] Literature from
   the Early Modern period includes the works of William Shakespeare and
   the translation of the Bible commissioned by King James I. Even after
   the vowel shift the language still sounded different from Modern
   English: for example, the consonant clusters /kn ɡn sw/ in knight,
   gnat, and sword were still pronounced. Many of the grammatical features
   that a modern reader of Shakespeare might find quaint or archaic
   represent the distinct characteristics of Early Modern English.^[47]

   In the 1611 King James Version of the Bible, written in Early Modern
   English, Matthew 8:20 says:

          The Foxes haue holes and the birds of the ayre haue nests^[37]

   This exemplifies the loss of case and its effects on sentence structure
   (replacement with Subject Verb Object word order, and the use of of
   instead of the non possessive genitive), and the introduction of
   loanwords from French (ayre) and word replacements (bird originally
   meaning "nestling" had replaced OE fugol).

   By the late 18th century, the British Empire had facilitated the spread
   of English through its colonies and geopolitical dominance. Commerce,
   science and technology, diplomacy, art, and formal education all
   contributed to English becoming the first truly global language.
   English also facilitated worldwide international
   communication.^[48]^[9] As England continued to form new colonies,
   these in turn became independent and developed their own norms for how
   to speak and write the language. English was adopted in North America,
   India, parts of Africa, Australasia, and many other regions. In the
   post colonial period, some of the newly created nations that had
   multiple indigenous languages opted to continue using English as the
   official language to avoid the political difficulties inherent in
   promoting any one indigenous language above the others.^[49]^[50]^[51]
   In the 20th century the growing economic and cultural influence of the
   United States and its status as a superpower following the Second World
   War has, along with worldwide broadcasting in English by the BBC^[52]
   and other broadcasters, significantly accelerated the spread of the
   language across the planet.^[53]^[54] By the 21st century, English was
   more widely spoken and written than any language has ever been.^[55]

   A major feature in the early development of Modern English was the
   codification of explicit norms for standard usage, and their
   dissemination through official media such as public education and state
   sponsored publications. In 1755 Samuel Johnson published his A
   Dictionary of the English Language which introduced a standard set of
   spelling conventions and usage norms. In 1828, Noah Webster published
   the American Dictionary of the English language in an effort to
   establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was
   independent from the British standard. Within Britain, non standard or
   lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised, leading to
   the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle
   classes.^[56]

   In terms of grammatical evolution, Modern English has now reached a
   stage where the loss of case is almost complete (case is now only found
   in pronouns, such as he and him, she and her, who and whom), and where
   SVO word order is mostly fixed.^[56] Some changes, such as the use of
   do support have become universalised. (Earlier English did not use the
   word "do" as a general auxiliary as Modern English does; at first it
   was only used in question constructions where it was not
   obligatory.^[57] Now, do support with the verb have is becoming
   increasingly standardised.) The use of progressive forms in  ing,
   appears to be spreading to new constructions, and forms such as had
   been being built are becoming more common. Regularisation of irregular
   forms also slowly continues (e.g. dreamed instead of dreamt), and
   analytical alternatives to inflectional forms are becoming more common
   (e.g. more polite instead of politer). British English is also
   undergoing change under the influence of American English, fuelled by
   the strong presence of American English in the media and the prestige
   associated with the US as a world power. ^[58]^[59]^[60]

   As of 2016, 400 million people spoke English as their first language,
   and 1.1 billion spoke it as a secondary language.^[61] English is
   probably the third largest language by number of native speakers, after
   Mandarin and Spanish.^[10] However, when combining native and
   non native speakers it may, depending on the estimate used, be the most
   commonly spoken language in the world.^[55]^[62]^[63]^[64] English is
   spoken by communities on every continent and on oceanic islands in all
   the major oceans.^[65]

   The countries in which English is spoken can be grouped into different
   categories by how English is used in each country. The "inner
   circle"^[66] countries with many native speakers of English share an
   international standard of written English and jointly influence speech
   norms of English around the world. English does not belong to just one
   country, and it does not belong solely to descendants of English
   settlers. English is an official language of countries populated by few
   descendants of native speakers of English. It has also become by far
   the most important language of international communication when people
   who share no native language meet anywhere in the world.

   Braj Kachru distinguishes countries where English is spoken with a
   three circles model.^[66] In his model, the "inner circle" countries
   are countries with large communities of native speakers of English,
   "outer circle" countries have small communities of native speakers of
   English but widespread use of English as a second language in education
   or broadcasting or for local official purposes, and "expanding circle"
   countries are countries where many learners learn English as a foreign
   language. Kachru bases his model on the history of how English spread
   in different countries, how users acquire English, and the range of
   uses English has in each country. The three circles change membership
   over time.^[67]

   Countries with large communities of native speakers of English (the
   inner circle) include Britain, the United States, Australia, Canada,
   Ireland, and New Zealand, where the majority speaks English, and South
   Africa, where a significant minority speaks English. The countries with
   the most native English speakers are, in descending order, the United
   States (at least 231 million),^[68] the United Kingdom (60
   million),^[69]^[70]^[71] Canada (19 million),^[72] Australia (at least
   17 million),^[73] South Africa (4.8 million),^[74] Ireland (4.2
   million), and New Zealand (3.7 million).^[75] In these countries,
   children of native speakers learn English from their parents, and local
   people who speak other languages or new immigrants learn English to
   communicate in their neighbourhoods and workplaces.^[76] The
   inner circle countries provide the base from which English spreads to
   other countries in the world.^[67]

   Estimates of the number of English speakers who are second language and
   foreign language speakers vary greatly from 470 million to more than
   1,000 million depending on how proficiency is defined.^[11] Linguist
   David Crystal estimates that non native speakers now outnumber native
   speakers by a ratio of 3 to 1.^[62] In Kachru's three circles model,
   the "outer circle" countries are countries such as the
   Philippines,^[77] Jamaica,^[78] India, Pakistan^[citation needed],
   Singapore,^[79] and Nigeria^[80]^[81] with a much smaller proportion of
   native speakers of English but much use of English as a second language
   for education, government, or domestic business, and where English is
   routinely used for school instruction and official interactions with
   the government.^[82]

   Those countries have millions of native speakers of dialect continua
   ranging from an English based creole to a more standard version of
   English. They have many more speakers of English who acquire English in
   the process of growing up through day by day use and listening to
   broadcasting, especially if they attend schools where English is the
   medium of instruction. Varieties of English learned by speakers who are
   not native speakers born to English speaking parents may be influenced,
   especially in their grammar, by the other languages spoken by those
   learners.^[76] Most of those varieties of English include words little
   used by native speakers of English in the inner circle countries,^[76]
   and they may have grammatical and phonological differences from
   inner circle varieties as well. The standard English of the
   inner circle countries is often taken as a norm for use of English in
   the outer circle countries.^[76]

   In the three circles model, countries such as Poland, China, Brazil,
   Germany, Japan, Indonesia, Egypt, and other countries where English is
   taught as a foreign language make up the "expanding circle".^[83] The
   distinctions between English as a first language, as a second language,
   and as a foreign language are often debatable and may change in
   particular countries over time.^[82] For example, in the Netherlands
   and some other countries of Europe, knowledge of English as a second
   language is nearly universal, with over 80 percent of the population
   able to use it,^[84] and thus English is routinely used to communicate
   with foreigners and often in higher education. In these countries,
   although English is not used for government business, its widespread
   use puts them at the boundary between the "outer circle" and "expanding
   circle". English is unusual among world languages in how many of its
   users are not native speakers but speakers of English as a second or
   foreign language.^[85]

   Many users of English in the expanding circle use it to communicate
   with other people from the expanding circle, so that interaction with
   native speakers of English plays no part in their decision to use
   English.^[86] Non native varieties of English are widely used for
   international communication, and speakers of one such variety often
   encounter features of other varieties.^[87] Very often today a
   conversation in English anywhere in the world may include no native
   speakers of English at all, even while including speakers from several
   different countries.^[88]

   Pie chart showing the percentage of native English speakers living in
   "inner circle" English speaking countries. Native speakers are now
   substantially outnumbered worldwide by second language speakers of

   English is a pluricentric language, which means that no one national
   authority sets the standard for use of the
   language.^[89]^[90]^[91]^[92] But English is not a divided
   language,^[93] despite a long standing joke originally attributed to
   George Bernard Shaw that the United Kingdom and the United States are
   "two countries separated by a common language".^[94] Spoken English,
   for example English used in broadcasting, generally follows national
   pronunciation standards that are also established by custom rather than
   by regulation. International broadcasters are usually identifiable as
   coming from one country rather than another through their accents,^[95]
   but newsreader scripts are also composed largely in international
   standard written English. The norms of standard written English are
   maintained purely by the consensus of educated English speakers around
   the world, without any oversight by any government or international
   organisation.^[96]

   American listeners generally readily understand most British
   broadcasting, and British listeners readily understand most American
   broadcasting. Most English speakers around the world can understand
   radio programmes, television programmes, and films from many parts of
   the English speaking world.^[97] Both standard and nonstandard
   varieties of English can include both formal or informal styles,
   distinguished by word choice and syntax and use both technical and
   non technical registers.^[98]

   The settlement history of the English speaking inner circle countries
   outside Britain helped level dialect distinctions and produce koineised
   forms of English in South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.^[99] The
   majority of immigrants to the United States without British ancestry
   rapidly adopted English after arrival. Now the majority of the United
   States population are monolingual English speakers,^[100]^[68] although
   English has been given official status by only 30 of the 50 state
   governments of the US.^[101]^[102]

   English is growing country by country internally and for international
   communication. Most people learn English for practical rather than
   ideological reasons.^[105] Many speakers of English in Africa have
   become part of an "Afro Saxon" language community that unites Africans
   from different countries.^[106]

   As decolonisation proceeded throughout the British Empire in the 1950s
   and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather
   continued to use it as independent countries setting their own language
   policies.^[50]^[51]^[107] For example, the view of the English language
   among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to
   associating it with economic progress, and English continues to be an
   official language of India.^[108] English is also widely used in media
   and literature, and the number of English language books published
   annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and
   UK.^[109] However English is rarely spoken as a first language,
   numbering only around a couple hundred thousand people, and less than
   5% of the population speak fluent English in India.^[110]^[111] David
   Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non native speakers,
   India now has more people who speak or understand English than any
   other country in the world,^[112] but the number of English speakers in
   India is very uncertain, with most scholars concluding that the United
   States still has more speakers of English than India.^[113]

   Modern English, sometimes described as the first global lingua
   franca,^[53]^[114] is also regarded as the first world
   language.^[115]^[116] English is the world's most widely used language
   in newspaper publishing, book publishing, international
   telecommunications, scientific publishing, international trade, mass
   entertainment, and diplomacy.^[116] English is, by international
   treaty, the basis for the required controlled natural languages^[117]
   Seaspeak and Airspeak, used as international languages of
   seafaring^[118] and aviation.^[119] English used to have parity with
   French and German in scientific research, but now it dominates that
   field.^[120] It achieved parity with French as a language of diplomacy
   at the Treaty of Versailles negotiations in 1919.^[121] By the time of
   the foundation of the United Nations at the end of World War II,
   English had become pre eminent ^[122] and is now the main worldwide
   language of diplomacy and international relations.^[123] It is one of
   six official languages of the United Nations.^[124] Many other
   worldwide international organisations, including the International
   Olympic Committee, specify English as a working language or official
   language of the organisation.

   Many regional international organisations such as the European Free
   Trade Association, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),^[54]
   and Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) set English as their
   organisation's sole working language even though most members are not
   countries with a majority of native English speakers. While the
   European Union (EU) allows member states to designate any of the
   national languages as an official language of the Union, in practice
   English is the main working language of EU organisations.^[125]

   Although in most countries English is not an official language, it is
   currently the language most often taught as a foreign
   language.^[53]^[54] In the countries of the EU, English is the most
   widely spoken foreign language in nineteen of the twenty five member
   states where it is not an official language (that is, the countries
   other than the UK, Ireland and Malta). In a 2012 official Eurobarometer
   poll, 38 percent of the EU respondents outside the countries where
   English is an official language said they could speak English well
   enough to have a conversation in that language. The next most commonly
   mentioned foreign language, French (which is the most widely known
   foreign language in the UK and Ireland), could be used in conversation
   by 12 percent of respondents.^[126]

   A working knowledge of English has become a requirement in a number of
   occupations and professions such as medicine^[127] and computing.
   English has become so important in scientific publishing that more than
   80 percent of all scientific journal articles indexed by Chemical
   Abstracts in 1998 were written in English, as were 90 percent of all
   articles in natural science publications by 1996 and 82 percent of
   articles in humanities publications by 1995.^[128]

   Specialised subsets of English arise spontaneously in international
   communities, for example, among international business people, as an
   auxiliary language. This has led some scholars to develop the study of
   English as an auxiliary languages. Globish uses a relatively small
   subset of English vocabulary (about 1500 words with highest use in
   international business English) in combination with the standard
   English grammar. Other examples include Simple English.

   The increased use of the English language globally has had an effect on
   other languages, leading to some English words being assimilated into
   the vocabularies of other languages. This influence of English has led
   to concerns about language death,^[129] and to claims of linguistic
   imperialism,^[130] and has provoked resistance to the spread of
   English; however the number of speakers continues to increase because
   many people around the world think that English provides them with
   opportunities for better employment and improved lives.^[131]

   Although some scholars mention a possibility of future divergence of
   English dialects into mutually unintelligible languages, most think a
   more likely outcome is that English will continue to function as a
   koineised language in which the standard form unifies speakers from
   around the world.^[132] English is used as the language for wider
   communication in countries around the world.^[133] Thus English has
   grown in worldwide use much more than any constructed language proposed
   as an international auxiliary language, including
   Esperanto.^[134]^[135]

   The phonetics and phonology of the English language differ from one
   dialect to another, usually without interfering with mutual
   communication. Phonological variation affects the inventory of phonemes
   (i.e. speech sounds that distinguish meaning), and phonetic variation
   is differences in pronunciation of the phonemes. ^[136] This overview
   mainly describes the standard pronunciations of the United Kingdom and
   the United States: Received Pronunciation (RP) and General American
   (GA) (See Section below on "Dialects, accents and varieties").

   The phonetic symbols used below are from the International Phonetic
   Alphabet (IPA).^[137]^[138]^[139]

   Most English dialects share the same 24 consonant phonemes. The
   consonant inventory shown below is valid for Californian American
   English,^[140] and for RP.^[141]

   In the table, when obstruents (stops, affricates, and fricatives)
   appear in pairs, such as /p b/, /tʃ dʒ/, and /s z/, the first is fortis
   (strong) and the second is lenis (weak). Fortis obstruents, such as /p
   tʃ s/ are pronounced with more muscular tension and breath force than
   lenis consonants, such as /b dʒ z/, and are always voiceless. Lenis
   consonants are partly voiced at the beginning and end of utterances,
   and fully voiced between vowels. Fortis stops such as /p/ have
   additional articulatory or acoustic features in most dialects: they are
   aspirated [pʰ] when they occur alone at the beginning of a stressed
   syllable, often unaspirated in other cases, and often unreleased [p̚ ]
   or pre glottalised [ˀp] at the end of a syllable. In a single syllable
   word, a vowel before a fortis stop is shortened: thus nip has a
   noticeably shorter vowel (phonetically, but not phonemically) than nib
   [nɪˑp̬] (see below).^[142]

   In RP, the lateral approximant /l/, has two main allophones
   (pronunciation variants): the clear or plain [l], as in light, and the
   dark or velarised [ɫ], as in full.^[143] GA has dark l in most
   cases.^[144]

   All sonorants (liquids /l, r/ and nasals /m, n, ŋ/) devoice when
   following a voiceless obstruent, and they are syllabic when following a
   consonant at the end of a word.^[145]
 voiceless sonorants: clay [ˈkl̥ɛɪ̯] and snow [ˈsn̥oʊ]
 syllabic sonorants: paddle [pad.l̩], and button [bʌt.n̩]

   The pronunciation of vowels varies a great deal between dialects and is
   one of the most detectable aspects of a speaker's accent. The table
   below lists the vowel phonemes in Received Pronunciation (RP) and
   General American (GA), with examples of words in which they occur from
   lexical sets compiled by linguists. The vowels are represented with
   symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet; those given for RP
   are standard in British dictionaries and other publications.

   In RP, vowel length is phonemic; long vowels are marked with a
   triangular colon ⟨ː⟩ in the table above, such as the vowel of need
   [niːd] as opposed to bid [bɪd]. GA does not have long vowels.

   In both RP and GA, vowels are phonetically shortened before fortis
   consonants in the same syllable, like /t tʃ f/, but not before lenis
   consonants like /d dʒ v/ or in open syllables: thus, the vowels of rich
   [rɪ̆tʃ], neat [niˑt], and safe [sĕɪ̆f] are noticeably shorter than the
   vowels of ridge [rɪdʒ], need [niːd], and save [seɪv], and the vowel of
   light [lăɪ̆t] is shorter than that of lie [laɪ]. Because lenis
   consonants are frequently voiceless at the end of a syllable, vowel
   length is an important cue as to whether the following consonant is
   lenis or fortis.^[146]

   The vowels /ɨ ə/ only occur in unstressed syllables and are a result of
   vowel reduction. Some dialects do not distinguish them, so that roses
   and comma end in the same vowel, a dialect feature called weak vowel
   merger. GA has an unstressed r coloured schwa /ɚ/, as in butter
   [ˈbʌtɚ], which in RP has the same vowel as the word final vowel in
   comma.

   An English syllable includes a syllable nucleus consisting of a vowel
   sound. Syllable onset and coda (start and end) are optional. A syllable
   can start with up to three consonant sounds, as in sprint /sprɪnt/, and
   end with up to four, as in texts /teksts/. This gives an English
   syllable the following structure, (CCC)V(CCCC) where C represents a
   consonant and V a vowel; the word strengths /strɛŋkθs/ is thus an
   example of the most complex syllable possible in English. The
   consonants that may appear together in onsets or codas are restricted,
   as is the order in which they may appear. Onsets can only have four
   types of consonant clusters: a stop and approximant, as in play; a
   voiceless fricative and approximant, as in fly or sly; s and a
   voiceless stop, as in stay; and s, a voiceless stop, and an
   approximant, as in string.^[147] Clusters of nasal and stop are only
   allowed in codas. Clusters of obstruents always agree in voicing, and
   clusters of sibilants and of plosives with the same point of
   articulation are prohibited. Furthermore, several consonants have
   limited distributions: /h/ can only occur in syllable initial position,
   and /ŋ/ only in syllable final position.^[148]

   Stress plays an important role in English. Certain syllables are
   stressed, while others are unstressed. Stress is a combination of
   duration, intensity, vowel quality, and sometimes changes in pitch.
   Stressed syllables are pronounced longer and louder than unstressed
   syllables, and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently reduced
   while vowels in stressed syllables are not.^[149] Some words, primarily
   short function words but also some modal verbs such as can, have weak
   and strong forms depending on whether they occur in stressed or
   non stressed position within a sentence.

   Stress in English is phonemic, and some pairs of words are
   distinguished by stress. For instance, the word contract is stressed on
   the first syllable (/ˈkɒntrækt/ KON trakt) when used as a noun, but on
   the last syllable (/kənˈtrækt/ kən TRAKT) for most meanings (for
   example, "reduce in size") when used as a verb.^[150]^[151]^[152] Here
   stress is connected to vowel reduction: in the noun "contract" the
   first syllable is stressed and has the unreduced vowel /ɒ/, but in the
   verb "contract" the first syllable is unstressed and its vowel is
   reduced to /ə/. Stress is also used to distinguish between words and
   phrases, so that a compound word receives a single stress unit, but the
   corresponding phrase has two: e.g. to búrn óut versus a búrnout, and a
   hótdog versus a hót dóg.^[153]

   In terms of rhythm, English is generally described as a stress timed
   language, meaning that the amount of time between stressed syllables
   tends to be equal. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer, but
   unstressed syllables (syllables between stresses) are shortened. Vowels
   in unstressed syllables are shortened as well, and vowel shortening
   causes changes in vowel quality: vowel reduction.

   Varieties of English vary the most in pronunciation of vowels. The best
   known national varieties used as standards for education in non
   English speaking countries are British (BrE) and American (AmE).
   Countries such as Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and South
   Africa have their own standard varieties which are less often used as
   standards for education internationally. Some differences between the
   various dialects are shown in the table "Varieties of Standard English
   and their features".^[154]

   English has undergone many historical sound changes, some of them
   affecting all varieties, and others affecting only a few. Most standard
   varieties are affected by the Great Vowel Shift, which changed the
   pronunciation of long vowels, but a few dialects have slightly
   different results. In North America, a number of chain shifts such as
   the Northern Cities Vowel Shift and Canadian Shift have produced very
   different vowel landscapes in some regional accents.

   Some dialects have fewer or more consonant phonemes and phones than the
   standard varieties. Some conservative varieties like Scottish English
   have a voiceless [ʍ] sound in whine that contrasts with the voiced [w]
   in wine, but most other dialects pronounce both words with voiced [w],
   a dialect feature called wine–whine merger. The unvoiced velar
   fricative sound /x/ is found in Scottish English, which distinguishes
   loch /lɔx/ from lock /lɔk/. Accents like Cockney with "h dropping" lack
   the glottal fricative /h/, and dialects with th stopping and
   th fronting like African American Vernacular and Estuary English do not
   have the dental fricatives /θ, ð/, but replace them with dental or
   alveolar stops /t, d/ or labiodental fricatives /f, v/.^[155]^[156]
   Other changes affecting the phonology of local varieties are processes
   such as yod dropping, yod coalescence, and reduction of consonant
   clusters.

   General American and Received Pronunciation vary in their pronunciation
   of historical /r/ after a vowel at the end of a syllable (in the
   syllable coda). GA is a rhotic dialect, meaning that it pronounces /r/
   at the end of a syllable, but RP is non rhotic, meaning that it loses
   /r/ in that position. English dialects are classified as rhotic or
   non rhotic depending on whether they elide /r/ like RP or keep it like
   GA.^[157]

   There is complex dialectal variation in words with the open front and
   open back vowels /æ ɑː ɒ ɔː/. These four vowels are only distinguished
   in RP, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. In GA, these vowels
   merge to three /æ ɑ ɔ/,^[158] and in Canadian English they merge to two
   /æ ɑ/.^[159] In addition, the words that have each vowel vary by
   dialect. The table "Dialects and open vowels" shows this variation with
   lexical sets in which these sounds occur.

   As is typical of an Indo European language, English follows accusative
   morphosyntactic alignment. Unlike other Indo European languages though,
   English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favor of
   analytic constructions. Only the personal pronouns retain morphological
   case more strongly than any other word class. English distinguishes at
   least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs,
   determiners (including articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some
   analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide
   conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators, and add the class of
   interjections.^[160] English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs,
   such as have and do, expressing the categories of mood and aspect.
   Questions are marked by do support, wh movement (fronting of question
   words beginning with wh ) and word order inversion with some verbs.

   Some traits typical of Germanic languages persist in English, such as
   the distinction between irregularly inflected strong stems inflected
   through ablaut (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem, as in the pairs
   speak/spoke and foot/feet) and weak stems inflected through affixation
   (such as love/loved, hand/hands). Vestiges of the case and gender
   system are found in the pronoun system (he/him, who/whom) and in the
   inflection of the copula verb to be.

   The seven word classes are exemplified in this sample sentence:^[161]
   The chairman of the committee and the loquacious politician clashed
   violently when the meeting started.
   Det. Noun Prep. Det. Noun Conj. Det. Adj. Noun Verb Advb. Conj. Det.
   Noun Verb

   English nouns are only inflected for number and possession. New nouns
   can be formed through derivation or compounding. They are semantically
   divided into proper nouns (names) and common nouns. Common nouns are in
   turn divided into concrete and abstract nouns, and grammatically into
   count nouns and mass nouns.^[162]

   Most count nouns are inflected for plural number through the use of the
   plural suffix  s, but a few nouns have irregular plural forms. Mass
   nouns can only be pluralised through the use of a count noun
   classifier, e.g. one loaf of bread, two loaves of bread.^[163]

   Possession can be expressed either by the possessive enclitic  s (also
   traditionally called a genitive suffix), or by the preposition of.
   Historically the  s possessive has been used for animate nouns, whereas
   the of possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns. Today this
   distinction is less clear, and many speakers use  s also with
   inanimates. Orthographically the possessive  s is separated from the
   noun root with an apostrophe.

   Nouns can form noun phrases (NPs) where they are the syntactic head of
   the words that depend on them such as determiners, quantifiers,
   conjunctions or adjectives.^[164] Noun phrases can be short, such as
   the man, composed only of a determiner and a noun. They can also
   include modifiers such as adjectives (e.g. red, tall, all) and
   specifiers such as determiners (e.g. the, that). But they can also tie
   together several nouns into a single long NP, using conjunctions such
   as and, or prepositions such as with, e.g. the tall man with the long
   red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles (this NP uses
   conjunctions, prepositions, specifiers and modifiers). Regardless of
   length, an NP functions as a syntactic unit. For example, the
   possessive enclitic can, in cases which do not lead to ambiguity,
   follow the entire noun phrase, as in The President of India's wife,
   where the enclitic follows India and not President.
